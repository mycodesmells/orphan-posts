# CSS Magic With Flexbox

I've never been a fan of creating styles for my applications. Over time I've came up with dozens of excuses why my apps are so ugly, or at least just lack of something special. Ever since I saw Bootstrap, I tend to use is almost every time, because it makes the look and feel much better in seconds. Why do I struggle with CSS? It might be that I don't have a feel for the UX, or that every time I try to style out a layout, something goes wrong and I loose my patience. Apparently at least one of my problems can be cured with a CSS3 feature - Flexbox layout.
